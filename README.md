Who I am and what I want to do!

# H1 A Bit About Me
I would be lying if I said that being a software developer/engineer was what I wanted to be when I grew up. My small high school in Idaho didn't offer much in terms of computer classes, and I wasn't exposed to the world of coding until many years after I graduated. My first step in life was joining the United States Air Force and being selected to maintain the advanced weapons systems of fighter aircraft! Sounds super cool, can sometimes be super cool, but not what I envisioned my life to be. After a tremendous amount of YouTube deep-diving and self reflection, becoming a software dev/eng is the path I want to trek down. 

## H2 Narrowing the Scope
In a, "Shoot for the stars, land on the moon." type mentality, I would love to work at a FAANG company or Quant shop in some sort of trader/dev/eng position. My intests in the finanical markets coupled with a desire to code has motivated me to build tools and algorithms that will help me and hopefully others navigate the world of money. 

### h3 What's Next?
1. Continue Self-Taught Journey
2. Acceptance to University in a CS field
3. Build Cool Projects
4. LeetCode
